This one day workshop is suitable for beginners and intermediate knitters; beginners should have some experience on a machine.

In the morning you will explore the creative possibilities of punchcard knitting; experimenting with different yarns and the techniques of fairisle, slip, tuck and weave to come up with a fabric design for your cushion cover.

You will practice making a turned up hem and button band with knitted-in button holes; techniques that could be translated into garments.

After lunch you will spend the afternoon knitting your unique cushion cover. Please note that the cushion pad is not included in the cost of the workshop, you can either bring one with you or pay an extra £5 and I will buy some in from Ikea.

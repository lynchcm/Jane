6 Week evening class, can be extended to 9 weeks if required.

This is suitable for beginners who have got some experience of machine knitting.

The logistics of knitting a garment over the duration of an evening class are tricky, so instead, this course will teach you the techniques required for garment knitting and enable you to integrate them into small-scale projects.

You will be taught a number of techniques and then Jane will help you to design and plan individual projects, which integrate those techniques. For example a cushion cover that incorporates a pocket and a button band with knitted in button holes!

The course will encourage you to get creative, and learn the skills to calculate knit patterns, and produce unique products that you can keep for yourselves or give as gifts.

There will be yarn available for you to use but you will be encouraged to start sourcing your own.

This course would suit those you have invested in a machine and want some help to get started. You should have attended a beginners course before starting this course.

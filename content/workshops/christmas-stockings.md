Come and learn to machine knit and make a Christmas stocking.

You do not need machine knitting skills, however it would help if you enjoy other crafts as some parts are quite tricky.

In the morning you will learn how to cast on with a neat edge, knit stripes, knit patterns with a punch card, turn a heel by partial knitting and bind off.

After a light lunch you will spend the afternoon knitting your stocking with lots of support from Jane.

As its Christmas, there will be a celebratory glass of fizz to celebrate your achievements!

Come and immerse yourself in machine knitting, to make this fabulous cotton tunic. It’s a great ‘throw-on’ for spring.

You can choose your colour from the range at Yeoman Yarns, maybe yours will be stripy?? Maybe yours will have a pocket... some variation from the pattern will be possible to make it unique to you. You will need to purchase the yarn prior to the workshop, and will need 800g.

You will need to be proficient with a transfer tool, as there will be lots of fully fashioning and binding off! 

Please see the gallery for more images of the jumper.

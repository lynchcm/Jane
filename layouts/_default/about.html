                <p>I fell in love with knitting while doing a BSc in Textiles and went on to do a PhD in seamless knitwear.</p>
                <p>When I’m not running workshops, I am an Associate Lecturer at Nottingham Trent University, helping fashion and textile students bring their ideas to life.</p>
                <p>Whether it’s at uni or in the workshop, my teaching philosophy is to have a go and make mistakes. That’s always when you learn the most!</p>

            <div class="bio-col col-2-desktop">
                <p>Rather than teaching you to replicate something, I teach you to understand the process of knitting: what do the dials and buttons do? This allows you to take what you’ve learnt, get creative, and apply it to your next project.</p>
                <p>Head to the <a href="/workshops">Workshops page</a> to see what’s coming up — I’m looking forward to meeting you soon!</p>
